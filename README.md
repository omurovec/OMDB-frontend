# About this Project
This project is a simple front end application to search and add movies from [OMBD](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to a nomination list. Built mainly with React and Redux, this application has a few key features to improve the user experience:

* Live Search - Search results appear as the user types
* Paged Results - The user can load more results if they reach the end of the results and still haven't found what they are looking for
* Responsive Desgin - The user is given a slightly different interface for mobile or desktop
* More Info Popup - The user can click on a title to see more info.
* Saved Nominations - Nominations are saved to localStorage so if the user closes the tab and re-opens it, their nominations will still be there

The hosted application can be found [here](https://omurovec.github.io/OMDB-frontend/)
